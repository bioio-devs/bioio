Image Reading, Metadata Conversion, and Image Writing for Microscopy Images in Pure Python

## Documentation

[See the full documentation on our GitHub pages site](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio/OVERVIEW.html)

## Example Usage (see full documentation for more examples)

Install bioio alongside OME TIFF and OME ZARR plug-ins with pip (this example won't use the OME ZARR plug-in):

`pip install bioio bioio-ome-tiff bioio-ome-zarr`

```python
from bioio import BioImage

# Get a BioImage object
img = BioImage("my_file.tiff")  # selects the first scene found
img.data  # returns 5D TCZYX numpy array
img.xarray_data  # returns 5D TCZYX xarray data array backed by numpy
img.dims  # returns a Dimensions object
img.dims.order  # returns string "TCZYX"
img.dims.X  # returns size of X dimension
img.shape  # returns tuple of dimension sizes in TCZYX order
img.get_image_data("CZYX", T=0)  # returns 4D CZYX numpy array

# Get the id of the current operating scene
img.current_scene

# Get a list valid scene ids
img.scenes

# Change scene using name
img.set_scene("Image:1")
# Or by scene index
img.set_scene(1)

# Use the same operations on a different scene
# ...
```
## Plug-in Registry

Bioio handles a variety of different image types through specific plug-ins. The bioio-dev supported plug-ins can be found within
this registry.

Each reader plugin should closely follow the specification laid out in `bioio-base`. As such, it is likely common that reader plugins won't distribute their own documentation and users should instead review  [`bioio_base.reader.Reader`](https://bioio-devs.github.io/bioio-base/bioio_base.html#bioio_base.reader.Reader) for API documentation for the underlying Reader API. We encourage plugin authors to publish their own documentation if they change or include new features into their published image readers.
